# UpScoolAssignmet1

## Hello to everyone.

**You can find my first assignment here at the Frontend Developer Bootcamp, which I continued with UpSchool.
The subject of the assignment was to contact the creator designers and clone the pages they prepared using HTML CSS and Bootstrap.
I contacted _Shahriar Sohag_ and cloned this page he designed. You can find many designs prepared by him by contacting us.**
